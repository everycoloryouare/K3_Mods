# Collection of K3 Modifications

**Beacon Compatible Nozzle Wiper and Purge Bucket**<br>
A modified nozzle wiper and purge bucket that works with the beacon probe instead of the default Quickdraw. It replaces the magnet activated swing arm used by Quickdraw with a fixed arm and ensures all parts are lower than the bottom of the beacon PCB.

<br>

**Glueless Tophat using M5 bolts**<br>
A redesign of the K3 tophat that replaces the printed dowel pins (which often needed to be glued together for rigidity) with M5 bolts and heat set inserts (or hex nuts). This allows the tophat to be more rigid and have less gaps for a better heated chamber.

**Wago mount for the Heated Bed**<br>
A small Wago mount that holds six of the two conductor Wagos for connecting the bed wires, thermistor, a ground wire, and an inline thermal fuse. The Wago mount fits under the bed between the rear bed mount and the (small) corner brackets. An eight Wago mount is listed below if more connections are desired.

<br>

**Detachable Spool Holder**<br>
The default spool holder is very minimal and not very easy to remove. This spool holder allows the protruding part to be removed easily and uses a piece of PTFE tubing as the bearing surface (based on the Voron Switchwire spool holder).

<br>

**Modified Electronic Box Panels, Grommets, and Brackets**<br>
Alternate electronic box panels that are dual tone and slightly thinner for a sleeker look. Also including are some alternate grommets for better wiring and chamber heating, and alternate electronic brackets to make assembly easier. Dual tone panels by Karabox that are the same thickness as the default panels are listed below.

<br>

**Sherpa Micro with fixed idler and integrated PTFE collet**<br>
A modified (RIDGA compatible) Sherpa Micro extruder that is based on the fixed idler Micro from the official github but has an integrated PTFE collet. A non fixed idler version with an integrated PTFE collet by Ryan G. is listed below. Note that for most K3 builds you will want a mirrored Sherpa Micro, which can be done in the slicer.

**Karabox's eBox**<br>
An entire electronic box redesign with many unique electronic mounting brackets and cable management solutions. And more importantly dual tone panels based on the default panel design.

<br>

**Airox's Dual Pane Tophat**<br>
An alternate tophat that uses two top panels and an interlocking design to reduce heat loss through the top for better chamber temperatures.

<br>

**Minsekt's Waveshare Electronic Box Screen**<br>
A modified electronic box panel that allows mounting of a 7.9 inch Waveshare Screen on the side of the electronic box (vertically). This is typically done in a "sidepack" configuration of the electronic box instead of a backpack. Requires modifications to one of the laser cut panels.

<br>

**Ryan G's Backpack Camera**<br>
A mount for using the large grommet feedthrough hole for a camera facing the build plate. Not the best angle but keeps the camera out of the hot chamber. Requires the PTFE and umbilical for the toolhead to be routed through one of the small grommet feedthroughs.

**MathematicaPotato's Metal Toolhead**<br>
Cut metal plates that replace the printed toolhead for a stiffer setup. Compatible with mosquito (or mosquito clones), dragon, or Chube hotends.

<br>

**Various Metal Motor Mounts for High Current Motors**<br>
If 2504 or 2804 motors are used at high currents, the motors can get quite hot, possibly melting the printed motor mounts. These motor mounts replace the printed parts to help with heat dissipation and increase stiffness.

**Chube High Flow Hotend**<br>
A very high flow and ridgid hotend designed, pricey but very high flow. Currently only compatible on the K3 with the metal toolhead plate above.

<br>

**Cbon's 3628 Fan Ducts and Alternate Z Idler for Chube**<br>
Printed parts for using extremely high airflow 3628 fars with Chube, and a lowered rear Z idler to make sure the entire build area is still usable without the fans colliding with the idler.

<br>

**Newtwo's Chonk K3 Frame**<br>
A completely new frame redesign that increases most extrusions to 2040 or 4040 which massively increases the printer stiffness and makes sealing and insulating the printer much easier. Also replaces the tophat with an extrusion based tophat which was not really feasible with the stock frame. Very expensive as it requires basically all new extrusions and panels.
